# Widgets

Widgets are the charts and metric boxes above the data table on a saved report. This file is the readable index; the canonical schemas have the full per-aggregator JSON Schema and the `_tl_intent_overrides` / `_tl_axis_branching` rules.

> **Schema source of truth**: [`intelligence_widget_schema.json`](intelligence_widget_schema.json) (report_type 1 / 2 / 3), [`sponsorship_widget_schema.json`](sponsorship_widget_schema.json) (report_type 8). Both define default sets, intent overrides, axis branching, and per-type aggregator catalogs.

Emit a `widgets` array of `{aggregator, type, index, width, height}` objects + a top-level `histogram_bucket_size`. **Every widget must add value to the user's prompt** — don't pad to a higher count.

## Widget JSON shape

```json
{ "aggregator": "<from catalog>", "type": "metrics-box" | "histogram" | "histogram-category",
  "index": <1-based, sequential>, "width": 2 | 3, "height": 1 }
```

Defaults: metrics-boxes → `width: 2`; histograms → `width: 3`. `height` is always `1`. Grid is 6 columns wide.

`histogram_bucket_size` (top-level, applies to all histograms):

| Date range | `histogram_bucket_size` |
|---|---|
| < 90 days | `"week"` |
| 90 days – 2 years | `"month"` (default) |
| Multi-year | `"year"` |

## Selection guidelines

1. 4–6 widgets per report (less = empty; more = clutter)
2. Mix metrics-boxes and histograms (good pattern: 3–4 metrics + 1–2 histograms)
3. First widget = primary aggregate for the report's purpose
4. Histograms last (higher `index`)
5. Never cross catalogs (intelligence aggregators on type-1/2/3, sponsorship aggregators on type-8 — disjoint)
6. `histogram_bucket_size` matches the date scope

## Default widget sets per ReportType (5 widgets each, index 1-5)

Per-widget `type`/`width`/`height` follow the global defaults above (metrics-box width 2, histogram width 3, height 1). Listed as `index. aggregator (type)`:

**Type 1 (CONTENT)** — 1. `total` (M), 2. `views_sum_metric` (M), 3. `views_avg_metric` (M), 4. `uploads_histogram` (H), 5. `views_sum_histogram` (H)

**Type 2 (BRANDS)** — 1. `brands_count_metric` (M), 2. `total` (M), 3. `views_sum_metric` (M), 4. `brands_count_histogram` (H), 5. `views_sum_histogram` (H)

**Type 3 (CHANNELS)** — 1. `channels_count_metric` (M), 2. `channel_subscribers_at_scrape_metric` (M), 3. `views_avg_metric` (M), 4. `channel_subscribers_at_scrape_histogram` (H), 5. `uploads_histogram` (H)

**Type 8 (SPONSORSHIPS)** — 1. `count_sponsorships` (M), 2. `sum_price` (M), 3. `count_channels` (M), 4. `count_sponsorships_over_<axis>` (H), 5. `sum_price_over_<axis>` (H). `<axis>` per branching table below.

## Intent-driven patterns

| Report type | Intent | Adjustment |
|---|---|---|
| Type 3 | outreach / product placements | Add `sponsored_brands_count_metric`; consider swapping a histogram for `channel_subscribers_at_scrape_difference_histogram` |
| Type 1 | engagement focus | Replace `views_avg_metric` with `likes_sum_metric` or `comments_avg_metric`; consider `views_30_avg_histogram` |
| Type 1 | sponsor-surfacing | Add `sponsored_brands_count_metric`; keep `total` + `views_sum_metric` for context |
| Type 2 | recency / momentum | Add `publication_date_max_metric` (surfaces "last mention") |
| Type 8 | pipeline / forecasting | Axis: `send_date`. Metrics: `count_sponsorships`, `sum_price`, `sum_impression` |
| Type 8 | won deals review | Axis: `purchase_date`. Metrics: `count_sponsorships`, `sum_price`, `sum_revenue`, `sum_profit` |
| Type 8 | performance / ROI | Replace one histogram with `count_sponsorships_over_performance_grade` (`histogram-category`). Metrics emphasize `roas`, `avg_cpv`, `sum_revenue` |
| Type 8 | assets / drafts QA | Replace value metrics with `count_sponsorships_where_published`, `_where_unpublished`, `_where_assets_are_incomplete`, `_where_draft_is_missing`. Drop or keep one histogram |

## Type-8 axis branching

Two date axes — `send_date` (scheduled) and `purchase_date` (won). Histograms branch on deal stage:

| `filters_json.publish_status` includes | Use axis |
|---|---|
| Pre-sale (7, 10) — matched / open | `send_date` (pipeline view) |
| Sold (3) only | `purchase_date` (won-deals view) |
| Mix of pre-sale + sold | `send_date` (pipeline view dominates) |
| Performance grades (winners/losers) | `purchase_date` |

Both `_over_<axis>` histograms in the same report use the SAME axis — don't mix within one report.

## Hard rules

1. Never cross catalogs (intelligence ↔ sponsorship aggregators are disjoint; server fails on the wrong catalog).
2. First widget = primary aggregate; don't bury the headline.
3. Histograms last.
4. `width: 2` for metrics-boxes; `width: 3` for histograms. Grid is 6 columns.
5. `height: 1` always.
6. `index` 1-based and sequential, no gaps.
7. `histogram_bucket_size` is top-level (one per report), not per-widget.
8. Type-8 axis consistency — both `_over_<axis>` histograms in one report share the axis.
9. Don't invent aggregator keys — surface a follow-up if the catalog can't express the user's request.
